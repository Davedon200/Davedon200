# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Michael David (Tish)
**`Software Developer (Flutter|Dart)`**

Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Michael David(tish) and I am a Flutter developer and open source enthusiast.

I have always been drawn to the power and potential of open source technology, and I am passionate about contributing to and learning from the amazing community of developers on GitHub. In my projects, you'll find a range of Flutter apps and libraries that showcase my skills and interests. From utility tools to beautifully designed user interfaces, I am constantly pushing myself to learn and create new things with Flutter. If you have any questions or just want to chat about Flutter and open source development, don't hesitate to reach out! I'm always happy to connect with like-minded developers and collaborate on new ideas.
